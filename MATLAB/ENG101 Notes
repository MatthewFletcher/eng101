help command gives man page for command

Community helps you when you don't know what you need (basically a matlab google)

help command gives you a text only version of help 


lookfor essentially googles the command in matlab's database


You can import data using the GUI in matlab

matlab previews data when you import a .xlsx file, shows the range in a preview of the data

Importing data as a set of column vectors results in the columns being imporrted individually 



%Import the batting averages for little league
%Use the variable to replace the omitting with zero

%Form column vectors for year, and the respective averages for players 



Software profiling can be used to show which parts of your code are takin gthe longest to run 

Keep track of size of variables for plotting

Plot toolbar helps with making graph look pretty

Use a semicolon to surpress output, use a % to make a comment

No need to declare variable before making variable assignment 



Scalar is 1 row, 1 column 
Row vector is 1 row and n columns
Column Vector is m rows and 1 column 
A matrix is m rows, and n columns 


Row vectors input using commas or spaces in between square brackets

Column vectors entered using semicolons and square brackets 

Row vectors entered in 1 of 2 ways:
1. If you want to know the interval, enter using range operator rowV=a:dx:b %from a to b with interval dx, b is NOT necessarily in the vector unless it is exactly on the dot 
2/ If you want to know the number of points, us rowV=linspace(a,b,n) %a to b, with n points between the two 



A=ones(3,3) makes a matrix full of ones
A=zeros(3,3) makes a matrix full of zeros
A=eye(3,3) makes an identity matrix 


A(3,4) gets index at row 3, column 4
A(end,end) gets index at bottom right hand corner
To grab pieces of matrix, us A([2 3],[3,4]) (this grabs )

To multiply individual aspects of a matrix, use .* and it will mutliply individual components of the matrix 

Scalars will expand for mutliplication of a vecto r


Multiplying A (an m by n matrix) and B (an x by y matrix) results in a m by y matrix. 


Use == as comparator in logical assignment

isequal(a,b) shows if the 2 variables are the same type



String comparison operators


~= = !=


strcmp is a string comparison, checks if the strings are identical 

AND, OR, and NOT are primitive logical operators


any(x==y) checks if ANY aspects of either vector are equal, while all(x==y) checks if ALL aspects are equal

When dealing with vectors, any(a==b) checks column by column 




Programming in MatLab

Use tic and toc as  qquick way of assessing the performance of your program 
Use tic to start a clock, use toc to stop it. 

Analyze code feature shows where you can improve your code 




Flow controal through selection. 

If structure: if true, do this otherwise do that. 
If elseif structure, if true do this, if false do that. 

Switch structrue

switch n;
	case case1
		do this
	case case2
		do that
	otherwise
		do something else
done



[x,y]=myfunction(a,b,c) is a function that takes a,b,c as inputs and returns x and y as outputs 

Matlab Functions 
Anonymous function (will be on test)

Private functionL
To make a private function, make a folder amed private, move the function file into the subfolder. 
Private folder cannot be added to the matlab search path 
Can only be called by functions in the same folder, or from the command line if the private folder is the current folder. 

Local functions group several functions of 1 application into a single file. 
ML searches by file and not function name, only the first function wtih each file ca be called from outside the file. 

Nested functions:
Used to bundle several functions of one application into a single file 
ALlow for hiding functionality from the user. 
Share workspace so they don't ahve to explicity pass variables. 


Anonymous function

f= @sin %allows you to use f instead of sin, essentially uses another name for function 

fzero allows you to find zeroes of a function 





calendarDuration(year, month, day)

datetime plus some number increments in days

between(datetime1, datetime2) gives year month day hour second.millisecond between 2 dates


week(CurrentTime) gives what week of the year it is 
day(datetime, 'name') gibes name of day of datetime

day(myBirthday+calyears(n), 'name') adds n years to birthday year and prints out name of day that birthday falls on
